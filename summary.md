### Deforestation and Forest Degradation in the Amazon Rainforest 

### Summary:

​	For this project I plan on focusing on the Amazon Rainforest. Deforestation in the Amazon is understood to have many negative short and long-term consequence. Through this project I would like to explore what data can tell us about the causes and consequences of continued deforestation and forest degradation in the Amazon. I was referred by my professor to a dataset, listed below as my primary dataset, which shows parcels of land which have been deforested. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2018. I will look at this in conjunction with datasets on the yearly fires in the Amazon Rainforest and the air quality in the region. I have not yet identified the datasets which will be optimal for this analysis for air quality, but NASA has several to choose from. For the fire data I will be using NASA’s FIRMS system data. Any past data exceeding 7 days needs to be requested, so I will make that a priority at the start of my work on this project.  



#### Datasets:

I plan on using the following dataset to make my analysis (subject to change):

- PRIMARY DATASET SOURCE: https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/4160f715e12d46a98c989bdbe7e5f4d6_1/data?geometry=-61.961%2C-4.916%2C-61.613%2C-4.796&orderBy=pathrow&orderByAsc=false&selectedAttribute=shape_Area
- Dataset with data on Amazon fires: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/ (NASA FIRMS system)
- NASA has several datasets related to air quality (undecided on which will be best for my analysis)
